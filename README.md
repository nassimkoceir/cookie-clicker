## What is all about ?
We had to create a small JS application : a cookie clicker. But we decided to change a bit of the concept and now, we present : Cat Clicker.  

We work all together on every bits of this project. We tried to work in pair programming on each side of this project : on the code or the graphical part.  

This project allowed us to understand the workflow of each member of the Cat Clicker, to explain to each member our choices and teach some great tips each other.

## When did you work on this project ?
We had 2 days to work on this, from 24 to 25th of september.

## Where did you work on this project ?
We were at Becode Brussels.
